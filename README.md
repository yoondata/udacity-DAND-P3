# udacity-DAND-P3

This is the third project that I completed for the Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) at Udacity in MAR-APR 2016. Using Python, I audited and cleaned OpenStreetMap data in XML (64MB) and transformed it to JSON. I then loaded the transformed data into MongoDB and ran a set of queries.

I chose to examine Oxford in England, whose map data was obtained from [Mapzen](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/). For reference, I have included in the current repo a sample of the original map data (1/10 of the original in size).

`PARK_Sangyoon_Udacity_DAND_P3.md` summarizes the data wrangling process and the query results.
